# Robot-Software
This is a Java program that allows the user to write programs for a hypothetical robot called Wall-E:

- Has 6 built-in basic actions for the robot: Move forward, Turn right/left, Grab an object, Release an object, Compact an object, Empty the Compactor

- Allows clients to create and edit programs for a robot using a set of these basic actions

- Prints to the screen the action currently being performed by the robot

- Contains unit testing of the whole software with JUnit
